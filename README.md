# Privelet-Project

The ```goal``` is to implement the 1-dimensional algorithm described in the Section 4 “Privelet for one-dimensional ordinal
data” of this  [research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5674037). 

Then to compare the implementation with a baseline solution (also implemented): a naive
differentially private perturbation of a sequence of counts.

You can find the implementations and report [here](privelet.ipynb) in a Python notebook.
